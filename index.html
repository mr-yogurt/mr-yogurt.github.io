  <p>You don't have javascript enabled. That's ruined my random redirect.
  <p>Knowing that there was a random redirect will probably mess with the surveys (there are two, which are slightly different. I would like to know how the differences affect responses), so it would probably be best if you just didn't take it.<br/>
